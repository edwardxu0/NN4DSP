Neural Network for Digital Signal Processing(NN4DSP)

This is a class project to synthesize FFT using neural networks.

### Instructions:
1) prepare the python3 virtual environment using the `requirements.txt`.
2) install [DNNV](https://github.com/dlshriver/DNNV) verifier at `./DNNV`.
3) Execute the implementation with the python notebook `nn4dsp.ipynb`.
4) Using the `run_verification.sh` to run the verification experiments.
