1)
One of the most popular method to certify the robustness of neural networks
is to use formal methods to prove the properties

A neural network verifier takes in a network and a property as inputs
and returns true if the property is proved, false if falsified, and also timeouts

Basically, a neural network property specifies that for all inputs satisfing the input constraint
the output of the network should also satisfy the output constraints


2)
For example, this robustness property specifies a perturbation upto .01 on the input,
such that the variance of the network's output should also not exceed .01


3)
We tested four different input perturbations for the small network and as a result,
the property is proved when perturbation is .01, timed out on .02, and falsified on .04 and .08


4)
To conclude, we fonnd that using neural network to approximate fourier transforms is generally
too slow and inaccurate but marginly robust to minor perturbations
